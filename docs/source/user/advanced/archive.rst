===================
Archiving a project
===================

If you don't want to use certain project anymore but want to keep
project files, you can archive it.

Project is going to be moved to `PET_FOLDER/archive` and is not
going to be shown in autocomplete

If project is not active it can be moved to archive to keep files safe.

To restore project from archive use *restore* command

.. code::

    $ pet archive project_name
    $ pet restore project_name

To check projects in archive folder use *pet list -o*
